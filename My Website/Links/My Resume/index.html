                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <p>I consider myself reliable, dynamic, and creative. I communicate well and feel 
                            comfortable working within a team. I have learnt to work well under pressure and in a 
                            stressful environment. I have developed a good initiative that enables me to find solutions 
                            to a problem and resolve them effectively and efficiently. I am excellent in working with 
                            others in order to achieve a certain objective on time and with efficiency.
